# Gruene App

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Conventions

### Code Style

We follow the [Effective Dart code style](https://dart.dev/effective-dart/style).

Code should be formatted using `dart format` ([docs](https://dart.dev/tools/dart-format)).

### Commits, Branches and Pull Requests

Branch names should be written using kebab-case and have the following schema:

```
<issue_key>-your-branch-name

1234-commit-message-documentation
```

Commit messages and PR names should have the following schema:
```
<issue_key>: Your commit message

1234: Add commit message documentation
```

See [this guide](https://github.com/erlang/otp/wiki/Writing-good-commit-messages) for a general reference on how to
write good commit messages.
